# MDD-Coursework-group-7
This project is completed by group 7 and would like to explian briefly how to use the prjoect.
The Xtext grammar provides how to implement the Trigonometry function such as sin, cos, and tan. The user should give the degree as input.

For example, below code represents to indicate how to use the language infrastructure and examples.

adjacent(10.0) cm

opposite(7.0) cm

hypotenuse(8.0) cm

var degree = 45

var degree2 = 90

var degree3=(degree+degree2)

sin(degree)

cos(degree2)

tan(degree3)

The grammar file is located in uk.ac.kcl.inf.cw.edu\src\uk\ac\kcl\inf\cw\edu\EduLangauage.xtext
